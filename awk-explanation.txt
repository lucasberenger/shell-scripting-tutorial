The awk command is a powerful text processing and data analysis tool in Unix/Linux systems. It's often used to manipulate and format text, as well as to perform operations on lines and columns of text files. 

The default mode of awk is using a space character as separator. Wecan print any item of a file using it. Let's create a file and see how it works.

echo one two three > awk.txt

awk '{print $1}' awk.txt 

The output should be the word one.

We also can use awk using to get values separate by a comma: 

echo one, two, three > awk-comma.txt

awk -F, '{print $1}'

This command should print the value 'one' the terminal
