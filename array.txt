We can create an array like this:

MY_ARRAY=(one two three four five)

The command 'echo $MY_ARRAY' will print only the first item from the array.
If we want to print all items, we use 'echo ${MY_ARRAY[@]}'.

So inside the square brackets we can use the @ to print all items or the index number of the specific item we want to print. 

For instance, we need to print the first number of the following array:
ARRAY=(first second third)

To do it, we use the command:
echo ${ARRAY[0]}

The output should be 'first'.
