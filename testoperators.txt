# We can ask to bash if some expression is true or not.
# The equal sign (=) is used to compare strings.
[ hello = hello ]
echo $?

# This should print an output equal to 0, as  both strings are the same.

[ hello = bye ]
echo $?

# Now the output should be 1, as the strings are different.


# Surely we can also use the test operators with numbers, but the difference isthat we use the '-eq' to compare numbers. If we do it the way we did above, we arenot comparing numbers but strings!!!

[ 1 -eq 1 ]
echo $?

[ 1 -eq 0 ]
echo $?
