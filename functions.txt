The basic syntax to create a function is:

nameofthefun(){
	do something
}

Let's create a function to use as example.


showmyname(){
	local myname="Lucas"
	echo $name
}
showmyname

This function is going to print the value of the variable name in the terminal. 
We just set it local to not overwrite a global one with the same name. 

Also is possible to create a function that will require a post argument to work correctly:

anothername(){
	echo Hello $1
}
