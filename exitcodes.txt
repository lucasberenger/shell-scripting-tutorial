Exit codes are the values that a if statement could return in a function. 

For instance, let's use the function we created before:

somefuncname(){
	echo Hello $1
	if [ ${1,,} = Lucas ]; then
		return 0
	else 
		return 1
	fi

somefuncname $1
if [ $? = 1 ]; then
	echo "Someone unknown called the function!/"
fi
